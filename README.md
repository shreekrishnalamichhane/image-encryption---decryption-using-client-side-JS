## Usecase

This feature can be implemented in end to end encrypted applications to transfer images. First we can encrypt the image in sender side using a common shared key, transfer it through relay server and then decrypt the image at receiver end using same shared secret key and render the image.

## Prerequisites

This application uses the following libraries.

- [Crypto JS](https://github.com/brix/crypto-js)
